Libraries Used
--------------
* [Architecture][10] - Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [lifecycle][22] - As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.
  * [Repository][18] - Repository modules handle data operations.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [View Binding][11] - a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
  * [Navigation][50] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [Coroutines][51] - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
  * [livedata][52] - is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
  
* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Fragment][34] - A basic unit of composable UI.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
  
* Third party and miscellaneous libraries
  * [Retrofit][90] for turns your HTTP API into a Java interface
  * [Paging3][95] The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network.
  * [OkHttp][91] OkHttp is an HTTP client thatâ€™s efficient by default
  * [Coil][92] for image loading
  * [Timber][94] This is a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
  * [Hilt][93] Hilt is the recommended solution for [dependency injection][21] in Android apps, and works seamlessly with Compose.
